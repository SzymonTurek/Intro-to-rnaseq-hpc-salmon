## Learning Objectives:

* Evaluate the quality of your NGS data using FastQC

### FastQC Results
   
Let's take a closer look at the files generated by FastQC:
   
```bash
$ ls -lh ~/rnaseq/results/fastqc/
```

#### HTML reports
The .html files contain the final reports generated by fastqc, let's take a closer look at them. Transfer the file for `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq` over to your laptop via *FileZilla*.

##### Filezilla - Step 1

Open *FileZilla*, and click on the File tab. Choose 'Site Manager'.

##### Filezilla - Step 2

Within the 'Site Manager' window, do the following: 

1. Click on 'New Site', and name it something intuitive (e.g. O2)
2. Host: transfer.rc.hms.harvard.edu 
3. Protocol: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol
4. Logon Type: Normal
5. User: ECommons ID
6. Password: ECommons password
7. Click 'Connect'

Once you have the html file copied over to your laptop, you should be able to open it in a browser. We are now all setup to look through our report and evaluate the quality of our sequence reads. 

> #### Other FastQC output files
> The other output of FastQC is a .zip file. These .zip files need to be unpacked with the `unzip` program. If we try to `unzip` them all at once:
>
> ```bash
> $ cd ~/rnaseq/results/fastqc/
> $ unzip *.zip
> ```
>
> Did it work?
>
> No, because `unzip` expects to get only one zip file. Instead we can use a `for loop` to iterate through the list of files in *.zip.
>
>```bash
> $ for zip in *.zip
> do
> unzip $zip
> done
> ```

## Assessing quality metrics	

Now that we have run FASTQC and downloaded the report, we can take a look at the metrics and assess the quality of our sequencing data!

FastQC has a really well documented [manual page](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) with [detailed explanations](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/) about every plot in the report. 

Within our report, a summary of all of the modules is given on the left-hand side of the report. Don't take the **yellow "WARNING"s** and **red "FAIL"s** too seriously; they should be interpreted as flags for modules to check out. 

<img src="../img/fastqc_summary.png" width="200">

The first module gives the basic statistics for the sample. Generally it is a good idea to keep track of the total number of reads sequenced for each sample and to make sure the read length and %GC content is as expected.

<img src="../img/fastqc_basic_stats.png" width="400">

One of the most important analysis modules is the **"Per base sequence quality"** plot. This plot provides the distribution of quality scores at each position in the read across all reads. This plot can alert us to whether there were any problems occuring during sequencing and whether we might need to contact the sequencing facility.

![FastQC_seq_qual](../img/FastQC_seq_qual.png)

The y-axis gives the quality scores, while the x-axis represents the position in the read. The color coding of the plot denotes what are considered high, medium and low quality scores. 

For example, the box plot at nucleotide 1 shows the distribution of quality scores for **the first nucleotide of all reads** in the `Mov10_oe_1` sample. The yellow box represents the 25th and 75th percentiles, with the red line as the median. The whiskers are the 10th and 90th percentiles. The blue line represents the average quality score for the nucleotide. Based on these metrics, the quality scores for the first nucleotide are quite high, with nearly all reads having scores above 28.

The quality scores appear to drop going from the beginning toward the end of the reads. For reads generated by Illumina sequencing, this is not unexpected, and there are known causes for this drop in quality. To better interpret this plot it is helpful to understand the different sequencing error profiles.

### Sequencing error profiles

For Illumina sequencing, the quality of the nucleotide base calls are related to the **signal intensity and purity of the fluorescent signal**. Low intensity fluorescence or the presence of multiple different fluorescent signals can lead to a drop in the quality score assigned to the nucleotide. Due to the nature of sequencing-by-synthesis there are some drops in quality that can be expected, but other quality issues can be indicative of a problem at the sequencing facility.

We will now explore different quality issues arising from the sequencing-by-synthesis used by Illumina, both expected and unexpected.

#### Expected

As sequencing progresses from the first cycle to the last cycle we often anticipate a drop in the quality of the base calls. This is often due to signal decay and phasing as the sequencing run progresses. 

- **Signal decay:** As sequencing proceeds, the fluorescent signal intensity decays with each cycle, yielding decreasing quality scores at the **3' end** of the read. This is due to:
   1. Degrading fluorophores
   2. A proportion of the strands in the cluster not being elongated
   
   Therefore, the proportion of signal being emitted continues to decrease with each cycle.

   <img src="../img/qc_signal_decay.png" width="400">
   
- **Phasing:** As the number of cycles increases, the signal starts to blur as the cluster loses synchronicity, also yielding a decrease in quality scores at the **3' end** of the read. As the cycles progress, some strands get random failure of nucleotides to incorporate due to:
   1. Incomplete removal of the 3' terminators and fluorophores
   2. Incorporation of nucleotides without effective 3' terminators

   <img src="../img/qc_phasing.png" width="500">
   
#### Worrisome

- **Overclustering:** Sequencing facilities can overcluster the flow cells, which results in small distances between clusters and an overlap in the signals. The two clusters can be interpreted as a single cluster with mixed fluorescent signals being detected, decreasing signal purity, generating lower quality scores across the **entire read**.

   <img src="../img/qc_overclustering.png" width="800">
   
- **Instrumentation breakdown:** Sequencing facilities can occasionally have issues with the sequencing instruments during a run. **Any sudden drop in quality or a large percentage of low quality reads across the read could indicate a problem at the facility.** Examples of such issues are shown below, including a manifold burst, cycles lost, and read 2 failure. For such data, the sequencing facility should be contacted for resolution, if possible.

### Quality assessment

Now if we return back to our plot, we can see a drop in quality towards the ends of the reads, which could be explained by signal decay or phasing. No other worrisome signs are present, so the sequencing data from the facility is of good quality. 

![FastQC_seq_qual](../img/FastQC_seq_qual.png)

The other modules in the FastQC report can also help interpret the quality of the data. 

The **"Per sequence quality scores"** plot gives you the average quality score on the x-axis and the number of sequences with that average on the y-axis. We hope the majority of our reads have a high average quality score with no large bumps at the lower quality values.

<img src="../img/fastqc_per_sequence_quality_scores.png" width="400">
  
This data has a small bump at a mean quality of 12. Since it doesn't represent a large proportion of the data, it isn't extremely worrisome, but it might be worth a quick check of the reads resulting in the poor quality scores.

The next plot gives the **"Per base sequence content"**, which always gives a FAIL for RNA-seq data. This is because the first 10-12 bases result from the 'random' hexamer priming that occurs during RNA-seq library preparation. This priming is not as random as we might hope giving an enrichment in particular bases for these intial nucleotides. 

<img src="../img/fastqc_per_base_sequence_content.png" width="400">

The **"Per sequence GC content"** plot gives the GC distribution over all sequences. Generally is a good idea to note whether the GC content of the central peak corresponds to the [expected % GC for the organism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2909565/). Also, the distribution should be normal unless over-represented sequences (sharp peaks on a normal distribution) or contamination with another organism (broad peak).

This plot would indicate some type of over-represented sequence with the sharp peaks, indicating either contamination or a highly over-expressed gene.

<img src="../img/fastqc_GC.png" width="400">

The next module explores numbers of duplicated sequences in the library. This plot can help identify a low complexity library, which could result from too many cycles of PCR amplification or too little starting material. For RNA-seq we don't normally do anything to address this in the analysis, but if this were a pilot experiment, we might adjust the number of PCR cycles, amount of input, or amount of sequencing for future libraries. In this analysis we seem to have a large number of duplicated sequences, but this is expected due to the subset of data we are working with containing the over-expression of MOV10.

<img src="../img/fastqc_duplication.png" width="400">

The **"Overrepresented sequences"** table is another important module as it displays the sequences (at least 20 bp) that occur in more than 0.1% of the total number of sequences. This table aids in identifying contamination, such as vector or adapter sequences. If the %GC content was off in the above module, this table can help identify the source. If not listed as a known adapter or vector, it can help to BLAST the sequence to determine the identity.

Since our data is just a subset of the original data and it contains the over-expressed MOV10 gene, if we BLAST the sequences we will find they belong to MOV10. For this experiment, these over-represented sequences are not concerning.

![FastQC_contam](../img/FastQC_contam.png)

As our report only represents a subset of reads (chromosome 1) for `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq`, which can skew the QC results. We encourage you to look at the [full set of reads](../fastqc/Mov10oe_1-fastqc_report.html) and note how the QC results differ when using the entire dataset.

After exploring the quality of the data, we determine from which gene or transcript the reads originated from using mapping tools. The quality of the data is important when determining where it aligns to on the genome or transcriptome, but the mapping tools we use (salmon and STAR) are able to account for adapter contamination, vector contamination and low-quality bases at the ends of reads. Therefore, after noting any QC issues, we can use our raw reads for the alignment or mapping to the reference genome or transcriptome.
